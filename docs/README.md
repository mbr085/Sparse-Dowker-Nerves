# Sparse dowker homology

In this tutorial we describe the use of the python package [dowker_homology](https://github.com/mbr085/Sparse-Dowker-Nerves) to calculate the persistent homology of point clouds, weighted networks and more general filtered covers. We have split the tutorial in two sections:

- [dowker_homology](dowker_homology_tutorial.html) describes the use of the state of the art package for calculating persistent homology from sparse Dowker nerves. This is the version most people should use. 

- [dowker_comparison](dowker_comparison_tutorial.html) describes how to compare different ways to truncate and sparsify Dowker nerves.
