Sparse dowker homology
======================

In this tutorial we describe the use of the python package `dowker_homology <https://github.com/mbr085/Sparse-Dowker-Nerves>`_ to calculate the persistent homology of point clouds, weighted networks and more general filtered covers. To read more about the theory behind the python package we refer to [1]_ and [2]_.
